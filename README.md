I love algorithms and since I entered college, they have been a constant in my development as a programmer. Throughout my journey as a student and developer, I have observed that many programmers focus on creating new tools without optimizing existing ones for the consumer. This is where competitive programming comes into play: it is my personal quest to generate effective and optimal solutions to everyday challenges, both as an individual and as a developer.  

My persistence and dedication are reflected in my constant participation in programming competitions. I have been part of competitions organized by different universities in Latin America, such as the RPC (Competitive Programming Network), achieving positions that are above average. In addition, I had the privilege of participating in a regional marathon of the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming League) and I have won several internal marathons at my university. On a regular basis, I am an active part of the tournaments organized in Codeforces, where I have demonstrated my skills and competencies in problem solving.  

These challenges have allowed me to gain experience and skills in effective complex problem solving, in addition to developing an analytical and strategic mindset that I apply in every project I am involved in. My Codeforces profile provides a detailed overview of my achievements and participation in programming competitions.
